# Glossary

Glossary of terms used in the Lingua Franca (LF) documentation.

### LF File
A source file with the `.lf` extension, representing a Lingua Franca (LF) program.

### Library File
An LF file containing one or more reactors intended for reuse, designed to be imported into other LF files.

### Package
A collection of LF source files and directories, along with a `Lingo.toml` manifest file that defines the package configuration. Every package must include an `src/` directory containing the LF source files.

### Package Manager
A software tool that automates the installation, configuration, and management of packages. In the LF ecosystem, the `lingo` package manager is used to manage LF packages and dependencies.

### Package Root
The **package root** is the top-level directory of a package where both the `Lingo.toml` file and the `src/` directory reside.

### Project
Another term for a [package](#package) that is under development. Each [LF file](#lf-file) is assumed to reside in a package, meaning it is located somewhere in the file system in a directory called `src`, in some directory that serves as the (package root)[#package-root].

### Project Structure
The structure of an LF project should follow the directory layout below:

```
├── .
│   ├── bin/                # Directory for storing generated code
│   ├── build/              # Directory containing packages installed by the Lingo Package Manager
│   │   ├── lfc_include/    # Directory for storing reusable reactors
│   │   └── <Installed Package>/ # Directory containing the installed package
│   ├── include/            # Directory for storing header files
│   ├── src/                # Directory containing LF source files
│   │   ├── lib/            # Directory for storing reusable reactors
│   │   │   ├── Input.lf    # Ex: reactor capturing external inputs (e.g., Microphone, Camera)
│   │   │   └── ComputerVision.lf # Ex: reactor performing computer vision tasks (e.g., object detection, face recognition)
│   │   └── Main.lf         # Ex: main source file
└── └── Lingo.toml          # Configuration file for Lingo Package Manager
```

- **Mandatory Directories and Files:**
  - `src/`: This folder must contain at least one `.lf` source file.
  - `Lingo.toml`: This is the required configuration file.

- **Automatically Generated Directories:**
  - `bin/`: This directory is created during the build process of source files. It is used to store generated code.
  - `build/`: This folder is automatically generated when installing packages managed by the Lingo Package Manager.
  - `include/`: This directory is autogenerated for header files.

- **User-Created Directory:**
  - `src/lib/`: This folder is for library files and should be created by the user as necessary.

This directory structure is essential for enabling the Package Explorer feature in the [VS Code Extension](tools/code-extension.mdx#package-explorer), streamlining project management and development processes.
