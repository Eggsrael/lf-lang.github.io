Glossary of terms used in the Lingua Franca (LF) documentation.

### LF File
A source file with the `.lf` extension, representing a Lingua Franca (LF) program.

### Package
A collection of LF source files and directories, along with a `Lingo.toml` manifest file that defines the package configuration. Every package must include an `src/` directory containing the LF source files.

### Package Root
The **package root** is the top-level directory of a package where both the `Lingo.toml` file and the `src/` directory reside.

### Project
Another term for a [package](#package) that is under development. Each [LF file](#lf-file) is assumed to reside in a package, meaning it is located somewhere in the file system in a directory called `src`, in some directory that serves as the (package root)[#package-root].

### Library File
An LF file containing one or more reactors intended for reuse, designed to be imported into other LF files.

### Package Manager
A software tool that automates the installation, configuration, and management of packages. In the LF ecosystem, the `lingo` package manager is used to manage LF packages and dependencies.
