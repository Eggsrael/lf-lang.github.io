# Overview
Lingua Franca's C-runtime supports [Patmos](https://github.com/t-crest/patmos),
a bare-metal execution platform that is optimized for time-predictable execution.
The time-predictability aspect of Patmos makes it easier to obtain a worst-case
execution time (WCET) for reactions.
## Prerequisites
- Linux or macOS development system. (use WSL on Windows)
- DE2-115 Development Kit, which is equipped with Altera Cyclone IV FPGA (optional)
### Getting Started
To know how to install the toolchain for building Patmos, read the Patmos project's readme at https://github.com/t-crest/patmos or study the sixth chapter of its handbook available here: [Patmos Reference Handbook](http://patmos.compute.dtu.dk/patmos_handbook.pdf)
### Compiling and Running Reactors
Patmos can run in an FPGA, but there are also two simulators available:

1. `pasim`: a software ISA simulator that is written in C++.
2. `patemu`: a cycle-accurate hardware emulator generated from the hardware description.

Consider the following simple LF program inside the HelloWorld.lf file: 
```lf-c
target C {
  single-threaded: true
}
main reactor {
  reaction(startup) {=
    lf_print("Hello World!");
  =}
}

```
After generating C code using `lfc HelloWorld.lf` command, add a Makefile file to compile LF-generated code inside `src-gen/HelloWorld` folder. In this Makefile mention the name of all generated c files, and the pathes of all header files. Here is a sample of such a Makefile file:
```Makefile
LF_PROJECT_ROOT ?= $(CURDIR)/../..
LF_MAIN_TARGET ?= HelloWorld
LF_MAIN_TARGET_LC := $(shell echo $(LF_MAIN_TARGET) | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')
LIB_PATH := ~/t-crest/local/patmos-unknown-unknown-elf/lib
SERIAL?=/dev/ttyUSB0

INCS := -I"$(LF_PROJECT_ROOT)/include" \
	-I"$(LF_PROJECT_ROOT)/include/api" \
	-I"$(LF_PROJECT_ROOT)/include/core" \
	-I"$(LF_PROJECT_ROOT)/include/core/platform" \
	-I"$(LF_PROJECT_ROOT)/include/core/modal_models" \
	-I"$(LF_PROJECT_ROOT)/include/core/utils" \

CC := patmos-clang 
CFLAGS := -O2 $(INCS) -DINITIAL_EVENT_QUEUE_SIZE=10 -DINITIAL_REACT_QUEUE_SIZE=10 -DLF_SINGLE_THREADED=0 -DLF_REACTION_GRAPH_BREADTH=1
SRC_FILES := _$(LF_MAIN_TARGET_LC)_main.c $(LF_MAIN_TARGET).c lib/schedule.c
SRC_FILES += core/reactor_common.c core/lf_token.c core/reactor.c core/tag.c core/environment.c 
SRC_FILES += core/utils/util.c core/utils/vector.c  
SRC_FILES += core/utils/pqueue.c core/utils/pqueue_tag.c core/utils/pqueue_base.c
SRC_FILES += core/utils/hashset/hashset_itr.c core/utils/hashset/hashset.c 
SRC_FILES += core/clock.c core/platform/lf_atomic_patmos.c core/platform/lf_atomic_irq.c 
SRC_FILES += core/platform/lf_patmos_support.c

OBJ_FILES := $(patsubst %.c,%.o,$(SRC_FILES)) 
EXE_NAME := $(LF_MAIN_TARGET).elf

.PHONY: all clean wcet

all: $(EXE_NAME)

# Target for the executable
$(EXE_NAME): $(OBJ_FILES)
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -o $@ $^
# Rule to compile C files into object files
$(OBJ_FILES): %.o: %.c
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c -o $@ $<

clean:
	rm -f $(OBJ_FILES) $(EXE_NAME)

```

Then move this Makefile inside the `src-gen/HelloWorld` folder and run the following make command:

    make -C src-gen/HelloWorld

If you are using an older version of LF that doesn't support Patmos, you need to copy `lf_patmos_support` c and h files in the related folders before executing make command whether manually or by executing the following bash file that automates the copying process (considering those files are located in a folder called `files`)

```bash
PROJECT_ROOT="$PWD"
PROJECT_NAME="HelloWorld"

cp "$PROJECT_ROOT/files/lf_patmos_support.h"     "$PROJECT_ROOT/src-gen/$PROJECT_NAME/include/core/platform/"
cp "$PROJECT_ROOT/files/platform.h"              "$PROJECT_ROOT/src-gen/$PROJECT_NAME/include/core/"
cp "$PROJECT_ROOT/files/lf_patmos_support.c"     "$PROJECT_ROOT/src-gen/$PROJECT_NAME/core/platform/"
cp "$PROJECT_ROOT/files/lf_atomic_patmos.c"      "$PROJECT_ROOT/src-gen/$PROJECT_NAME/core/platform/"
cp "$PROJECT_ROOT/files/lf_patmos_support.h"     "$PROJECT_ROOT/include/core/platform/"
cp "$PROJECT_ROOT/files/platform.h"              "$PROJECT_ROOT/include/core"
```

If there is no error after making, an HelloWorld.elf file must be generator inside `src-gen\HelloWorld` folder. Then, the reactor can be executed on the SW simulator with the following command:

    pasim src-gen\HelloWorld\HelloWorld.elf

After executing the above command, the following lines must be printed.
```
Hello World!
---- Elapsed logical time (in nsec): 0
---- Elapsed physical time (in nsec): 770,000
```

The reactor can also be executed on the hardware emulator of Patmos:

    patemu src-gen\helloworld\HelloWorld.elf

This execution is considerably slower than the SW simulator, as the concrete hardware
of Patmos is simulated cycle-accurate. Here is a sample of its output:

```
Hello World!
---- Elapsed logical time (in nsec): 0
---- Elapsed physical time (in nsec): 3,459,000
```
