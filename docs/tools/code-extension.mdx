The Lingua Franca extension for Visual Studio Code (VS Code) provides syntax-directed editing capability, compilation, diagram synthesis and a package explorer for Lingua Franca programs.

## Usage

### Creating a New Package

You can create a new LF package either manually by creating an LF file or by using the [Lingo Package Manager](https://github.com/lf-lang/lingo).

#### Option 1: Manually Create an LF File
1. Go to <kbd>File > New File...</kbd> and select `New Lingua Franca File`.
2. Save the file in a directory called `src` to ensure that generated code is placed in a parallel `src-gen` directory. For example, if your file is called `Foo.lf`, the directory structure after building will look like this:

```
├── LF Package
│   ├── bin/
│   │  └── Foo
│   ├── src/
│   │  └── Foo.lf
│   ├── src-gen/
│   │   ├── Foo/
...
```

Additionally, it's important to manually create the `Lingo.toml` file adjacent to the `src` folder in the root directory of the package.. This file serves as a configuration for the package, allowing you to specify the package name, version, and other metadata, including any dependencies you want to install.

#### Option 2: Create an LF Package Using the Lingo Package Manager
1. After installing and configuring the Lingo Package Manager, create an empty folder with the desired name for the LF package.
2. Open the folder in VS Code.
3. Open the terminal in this folder and run the <kbd>lingo init</kbd> command. 

This will set up a new LF package with the following structure:

```
├── LF Package
│   ├── src/
│   │  └── Main.lf
└── └── Lingo.toml # Configuration file for current package
```

### Opening an Existing LF package

To open an existing LF package in VS Code, select the root directory of your Lingua Franca package as your workspace.

The correct structure of the LF package should look like this:

```
├── root
│   ├── bin/
│   ├── build/   # directory containing packages installed by Lingo Package Manager
│   │  ├── lfc_include/ # Directory for storing reusable reactors
│   │  └── └── installed_library/
│   ├── include/
│   ├── src/
│   │  ├── lib/ # Directory for storing reusable reactors
│   │  │   ├── Input.lf # Ex: reactor capturing external inputs (e.g., Microphone, Camera)
│   │  │   └── ComputerVision.lf # Ex: reactor performing computer vision tasks (e.g., object detection, face recognition)
│   │  └── Main.lf # Ex: main source file
└── └── Lingo.toml # Configuration file for Lingo Package Manager
```

To correctly enable the [Package Explorer](#package-explorer), we recommend opening VS Code with the true root of your Lingua Franca package as your workspace. If the package structure deviates from the expected format, an error message will appear when opening the Package Explorer:

### Rendering Diagrams

To show the diagram for the currently active Lingua Franca file, click on the diagrams icon at the upper right:

### Compilation

To compile the `.lf` source, open the command palette (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd>) and then enter `Lingua Franca: Build`.

### Running

You can also build and immediately afterwards run your code by opening the command palette (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd>) and then entering `Lingua Franca: Build and Run`.
Running the code can also be done from the VS Code terminal by executing the generated file in `./bin`.

### Package Explorer

The **Lingua Franca Package Explorer** can be accessed by clicking on the **LF icon** in the activity bar on the left side of the screen. Once opened, the **Package Explorer** displays a **Tree View** with the following structure:

```
├── LF Package
│   ├── Installed Packages
│   ├── Local Libraries
└── └── Source Files
```

- [**Installed Packages**](#installed-packages): Lists libraries installed via the Lingo Package Manager, located in the `build/lfc_include` directory (if any).
  
- [**Local Libraries**](#local-libraries): Displays locally defined libraries (e.g., reusable reactors), located in the `src/lib` directory.
  
- [**Source Files**](#source-files): Contains the LF source files created by the developer, located in the `src` directory.

The **Source Files** section is always present as it reflects the main LF files in the package. However, the **Installed Packages** and **Local Libraries** sections appear only if the respective directories and files exist in the workspace.

Hovering over the **LF Package** item reveals a terminal icon. Clicking this icon opens a terminal window at the package's root directory, allowing you to execute commands directly within that directory.

#### Installed Packages

The **Installed Packages** section lists libraries installed using the [Lingo Package Manager](https://github.com/lf-lang/lingo). Developers can use the Lingo Package Manager to retrieve and install LF programs from repositories such as the [Lingua Franca Community Organization](https://github.com/LF-Community).

To install libraries:
1. Configure the `Lingo.toml` file with the desired libraries.
2. Run <kbd>lingo build</kbd> in the terminal from the current directory to download the specified dependencies.

Once the libraries are installed, they will appear in the `{package_name}/build/lfc_include/` directory. The **Installed Packages** section will then be structured as follows:

```
├── LF Package
│   ├── Installed Packages
│   │  ├── installed_library/
│   │  │   ├── File_1.lf
│   │  │   │   ├── Rusable_Reactor_1.lf
│   │  │   │   ├── Rusable_Reactor_2.lf
│   │  │   ├── File_2.lf
│   │  │   │   ├── Rusable_Reactor_1.lf
│   │  │   │   ├── Rusable_Reactor_2.lf
...
```

In this structure:
- **LF Package**: Represents the root folder of the main package.
- **installed_library**: Represents each library listed in `Lingo.toml`, which contains one or more LF programs featuring reusable reactors.

The image below shows a visual representation of the **Installed Packages** section. The **project** icon indicates the LF Package folder (e.g., `AudioClassification`), while the **root-folder** icon represents the downloaded libraries (e.g., the `edgeai` library in the example). The **code file** icon denotes an LF program within a library, and the **bracket** icon represents individual reactors inside the LF program.

<Image img={lingo_packages} style={{maxWidth: 400}} />

The hierarchy categorizes tree items into the following types:

1. **`library-root`**: Refers to the root folder of each downloaded library.
2. **`file`**: Represents an LF program within the library.
3. **`reactor`**: Refers to individual reactors within the LF program.

When focusing on the **Installed Packages** section, an `edit` command becomes available. Clicking it opens the `Lingo.toml` file in the editor for configuration changes. The following actions are available for items in the **Installed Packages** section:

- For **file** items (from right to left):
  - **Open in Split View**: Opens the file in a split editor view.
  - **Go To File**: Navigates to the file in the editor.
  
- For **reactor** items (from right to left):
  - **Import Selected Reactor**: Imports the selected reactor into the active LF program.
  - **Go To File**: Opens the file where the reactor is defined.
  - **Open in Split View**: Opens the file in a split editor view (accessible by right-clicking the item).

:::note
The **Import Selected Reactor** option is available only if an LF program is open in the editor.
:::

#### Local Libraries

The **Local Libraries** section lists LF programs created by the developer, located in the `{package_name}/src/lib/` directory. These programs serve as local libraries, containing reusable reactors. The directory structure follows this format:

```
├── LF Package
...
│   ├── Local Libraries
│   │  ├── File_1.lf
│   │  │   ├── Rusable_Reactor_1.lf
│   │  │   ├── Rusable_Reactor_2.lf
│   │  ├── File_2.lf
│   │  │   │   ├── Rusable_Reactor_1.lf
│   │  │   │   ├── Rusable_Reactor_2.lf
...
```

The image below illustrates the **Local Libraries** section. In this depiction, the **"project"** icon represents the LF package folder, while the **"code file"** icon represents the LF program, and the **"bracket"** icon denotes individual reactors within the LF program.

<Image img={local_libraries} style={{maxWidth: 400}} />

The hierarchy categorizes tree items into two types:

1. **`file`**: Represents the LF program.
2. **`reactor`**: Represents a reactor within the LF program.

Actions for **Local Libraries** are similar to those in the [**Installed Packages**](#installed-packages) section:

- For **file** items (from right to left):
  - **Open in Split View**: Opens the file in a split editor view.
  - **Go To File**: Navigates to the file in the editor.
  
- For **reactor** items (from right to left):
  - **Import Selected Reactor**: Imports the selected reactor into the active LF program.
  - **Go To File**: Opens the file where the reactor is defined.
  - **Open in Split View**: Opens the file in a split editor view (accessible by right-clicking the item).

:::note
The **Import Selected Reactor** option is available only if an LF program is open in the editor.
:::

#### Source Files

The **Source Files** section lists all LF programs in the `{package_name}/src/` directory. This section provides direct access to the main source files of the package. The hierarchy for this view is straightforward:

```
├── LF Package
...
│   ├── Local Libraries
│   │  ├── File_1.lf
│   │  ├── File_1.lf
│   │  ├── File_1.lf
...
```

Clicking on any of the files will open the corresponding LF program in the editor, allowing developers to quickly navigate to and edit the source code of their package.

## Notes

### For Python Users

Users who edit LF programs with a Python target will benefit the most from Python linting by installing Pylint 2.12.2 or later.
