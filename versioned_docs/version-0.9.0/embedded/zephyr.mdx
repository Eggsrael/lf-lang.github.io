description: Developing LF Programs for Zephyr RTOS.
---
# Overview
Lingua Franca's C-runtime supports the Zephyr RTOS. This enables developing and
programming [hundreds](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/boards/index.html)
of resource-constrained microcontrollers. In this guide we will see how LF
programs can be built, programmed and debugged both in emulation and on real
hardware. When developing LF programs for Zephyr we use a `west`-centric
approach. Using `west`, which is the preferred build tool for Zephyr projects,
requires structuring the code base and development flow as expected by `west`.
We use a [T3 Forest
Topology](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/develop/west/workspaces.html#west-t3)
for our workspace. This means that we create a workspace where multiple
different LF Zephyr projects can be hosted together with a single copy of the
Zephyr RTOS sources.

## Prerequisites
- Linux or macOS development system. (The guide is written for Linux)
- nrf52 Development Kit (optional)

# Getting started
The first step is to set up a proper Zephyr v3.7.0 development environment. Follow the
steps in the **Install dependencies** and **Install Zephyr SDK** sections of the
official [Zephyr Getting Started
Guide](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/3.7.0/develop/getting_started/index.html).
Do not perform the steps under **Get Zephyr and install Python
dependencies**. These steps will be performed inside the LF Zephyr workspace we
are going to create next.

## Setting up the LF Zephyr workspace

1. Clone the template repository into a workspace directory of Zephyr projects
```
git clone https://github.com/lf-lang/lf-west-template lf-zephyr-workspace && cd lf-zephyr-workspace
```

2. Setup and activate a virtual environment
```
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install `west`
```
pip3 install west
```

Now `west` is installed within a virtual environment. **This environment has to
be activated every time you want to use west with LF**

4. Get the Zephyr source code
```
west update
```

5. Export CMake packages for Zephyr
```
west zephyr-export
```

6. Install Python dependencies
```
pip install -r deps/zephyr/scripts/requirements.txt
```

## Workspace organization
Now you should have the following installed:
-`west`; Verify with `west boards`
- Zephyr SDK v0.16.8 located at `/opt/zephyr-sdk-0.16.8`
- Zephyr RTOS v3.7.0 pulled down to `deps/zephyr`
- A few example applications under `apps/`

This workspace is meant to house all of your different LF Zephyr apps, as long
as they are using the same version of Zephyr. Each app has to contain the
following:
```
<app>
├── app.overlay
├── prj.conf
├── Kconfig
└── src
    └── MyApplication.lf
```

Our custom west-extension will invoke `lfc` and create a `src-gen` directory
structured as a [Zephyr
application](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/develop/application/index.html).
This generated project can then be built, emulated or flashed by `west`.



## Hello World!

You should now be able to build and emulate a simple "Hello World" LF program:

```
cd apps/HelloWorld
lfc src/HelloWorld.lf -n
west build src-gen/HelloWorld -t run
```
`HelloWorld.lf` has the target properties `platform: "Zephyr"` and `threading:
false`. This tells `lfc` to create a Zephyr-compatible CMake project. Then we
use `west` to build the generated CMake project and to start an emulation.

To enable **west-centric** development we have added a custom west command,
`west lfc`. It is a wrapper around the original lfc but also copies the files
`prj.conf` and `Kconfig` into to generated project. It can also invoke `west
build` directly. The above example can be compiled and emulated with the
following command:
```
west lfc src/HelloWorld.lf --build "-t run"
```

The string within the quotation marks after `--build` is passed on to `west
build`.

## Nrf52 blinky
In this example we will program a simple Blinky program onto an nrf52dk. This
requires an actual nrf52 board and also the `nrfjprog` utility is installed. See
the following installation guide
[here](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-tools/nrf-command-line-tools/download).

```
cd apps/NrfBlinky
west lfc src/NrfBlinky.lf --build "-p always -b nrf52dk_nrf52832"
west flash
```
In this example we use the `-p always` to tell west to do a clean build and `-b
nrf52dk_nrf52832` to target the nrf52dk. These parameters are west-specific so
refer to west documentation for more info. `west flash` is used to interact with
`nrfjprog` and flash the application into the dev-board.

## Bare-bones Zephyr app
We also have a simple example of a bare-bones Zephyr app. This requires a
physical board. 

```
cd apps/HelloZephyr
west build -b nrf52dk_nrf52832 -p always
west flash
```

# Zephyr configuration options
The Lingua Franca Zephyr platform depends on some specific [Zephyr Kernel
configurations](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/build/kconfig/index.html#).
For instance, the Counter drivers must be linked with the application to provide
hi-resolution timing. These required configurations are stored in a file called
`prj_lf.conf` which `lfc` generates into the `src-gen` folder. You can provide
your own configurations through the following three files that `west lfc`
expects to find at the root of each app:
1. `prj.conf`, see [Setting symbols in Configuration systems (Kconfig)](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/build/kconfig/setting.html#setting-symbols-in-configuration-files) 
2. `Kconfig`, see [Configuration system (Kconfig)](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/build/kconfig/index.html)
3. `app.overlay`, see [Devicetree](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/build/dts/index.html#devicetree)

The config options provided by you will be merged with those provided by `lfc`
and default settings for the board. It is very useful to inspect the final
version of the Kconfig and devicetree. After compilation, these are found in
`build/zephyr/.config` and `build/zephyr/zephyr.dts`. You can also inspect the
Kconfig options and devicetree by calling:
```
west build -t menuconfig
west build -t guiconfig
```
These are very powerful tools that give you a lot of insight into the application
you have just built.

# The `west lfc` command
The custom `lfc` west command has already been used in previous sections. It can
be inspected in `scripts/lfc.py`. It invokes `lfc` on the provided LF
source file. It also copies `app.overlay`,`prj.conf` and `Kconfig` into the
src-gen directory before it, optionally, calls `west build` on the resulting
project.

Please see `west lfc --help` for more information and the `scripts/lfc.py`.

# LFC-centric development
In this guide we have shown how LF Zephyr apps can be developed in a
`west`-centric manner. It is also possible to target Zephyr in a `lfc`-centric
approach. When you give `lfc` a LF program with the `platform` target property
set to `Zephyr`, it will generate a Zephyr project that can be built with
`west`. For this to work, the environment variable `ZEPHYR_BASE` must be set to
point to the Zephyr RTOS sources. To demonstrate this, create a simple example
program:
```
cat >> LfcCentricZephyr.lf << 'END'
target C {
    platform: "Zephyr"
}
main reactor{
    reaction(startup) {=
        lf_print("Hello World!");
    =}
}
END
```

If `west` is installed in a virtual environment, activate it, and set up the
environment. Assuming that the template is located at `/home/lf-zephyr-workspace`

```
source /home/lf-zephyr-workspace/.venv/bin/activate
export ZEPHYR_BASE=/home/lf-zephyr-workspace/deps/zephyr
lfc LfcCentricZephyr.lf
```

This will create a Zephyr project at `src-gen/LfcCentricZephyr` and invoke
the Zephyr toolchain to compile it. Since we have not specified any board,
the default, which is `qemu_cortex_m3`, is used. We can run an emulation of
the program with:
```
cd src-gen/LfcCentricZephyr
west build -t run
```

# Timing-precision
There exist two different Zephyr implementations of the LF timing API. The
default is based on the [Zephyr Kernel
Timing](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/kernel/services/timing/clocks.html).
It is simple and supported on all boards with Zephyr support. However it is not
that precise. E.g. for the nRF52 boards it is based on a 32KHz timer, while for
many other boards is a 10Khz timer. This limits the timing-precision to 10s-100s
of microseconds.

If this is not sufficient, the LF timing API based on the [Zephyr
Counter](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/hardware/peripherals/counter.html)
can be used. This is an abstraction of a generic timer peripheral which is found
on many MCUs. The Counter API can give time-precision in the order of 10s of
nanoseconds. Not all boards have implemented the Counter API, and not all
implementations includes all the features that is needed to implement the LF 
timing API. Currently we have only tested with nRF52, iMXRT1170 and ESP32.

To compile with the Counter API, we must enable the counter device in the `prj.conf` file:
```
CONFIG_COUNTER=y
```
and pass an extra flag to CMake:

```
cd apps/NrfBlinky
west lfc src/NrfBlinky.lf --build "-p always -b nrf52dk_nrf52832 -- -DLF_ZEPHYR_CLOCK_COUNTER=1"
```

# C libraries
Zephyr has support for three C library implementations. 
- Newlib (Default library used by LF)
- Picolibc (Supported by LF)
- Minimal libc (Not supported yet by LF)

For LF programs targeting Zephyr, Newlib is the default C library. You can
inspect the file `lf_prj.conf` which will be copied into the `src-gen` by `lfc`
when compiling a LF program with Zephyr as the target platform. Here you will find:"
```
CONFIG_NEWLIB_LIBC=y
CONFIG_NEWLIB_LIBC_FLOAT_PRINTF=y
```

This setting can be overridden in the user-written `prj.conf` file. If you wish
to use Picolibc instead put the following in your `prj.conf` file:
```
CONFIG_NEWLIB_LIBC=n
CONFIG_NEWLIB_LIBC_FLOAT_PRINTF=n
CONFIG_PICOLIBC=y
CONFIG_PICOLIBC_IO_FLOAT=y
```

With some additional work we could also get the LF runtime working with Minimal
libc. It should reduce the code size considerably.

# Debugging LF Zephyr programs using QEMU and GDB
In this section we will see how a LF program can be debugged while running in
QEMU emulation.

1. Compile `HelloWorld.lf` for `qemu_cortex_m3`
```
cd apps/HelloWorld
west lfc src/HelloWorld.lf --build "-b qemu_cortex_m3 -p always"
```
Note that we here, unlike the very first example, explicitly tell `lfc` that we
are targeting a `qemu_cortex_m3` platform. This is the default platform which is
used unless another is specified. It is added here for clarity. 

2. In one terminal, start qemu as a debug server waiting for a local connection
   from `gdb`
```
ninja -C build debugserver
```

3. In another terminal start `gdb` and connect to the qemu server. Load the
   application image and run until main.
```
/ZEPHYR_SDK_INSTALL_DIR/arm-zephyr-eabi/bin/arm-zephyr-eabi-gdb
(gdb) target remote localhost:1234
(gdb) file build/zephyr/zephyr.elf
(gdb) b main
(gdb) c
```

From here you can step through the LF program. To get a more visual interface you can try:
```
(gdb) tui enable
```

## Timing in QEMU emulations
The QEMU emulation is not cycle-accurate and implements optimizations such that
if the system goes to sleep, like when the last active thread in the program
calls `k_sleep()`, then the emulator fast-forwards time. This causes the
emulation of threaded programs to appear as if the `fast` target property was
set to `true`. 

## Troubleshooting

### ESP32
Several users have reported problems with using ESP32 and Newlib, which is the
default C library used by LF programs targeting Zephyr. A workaround is to use
Picolibc instead. See the chapter on "C libraries" for a description of how to
change C library implementation.

### Multiple Zephyr installations
If the following warning is shown when invoking `west lfc` or any other `west`
command:
```
WARNING: ZEPHYR_BASE=/path/to/zephyr in the calling environment will be used,
but the zephyr.base config option in /path/to/lf-west-template is "deps/zephyr"
which implies a different ZEPHYR_BASE=/path/to/lf-west-template/deps/zephyr
To disable this warning in the future, execute 'west config --global zephyr.base-prefer env'
```

Then it means that you have multiple Zephyr repositories installed. We do not
recommend this as `west` will link the application with the Zephyr found in the
CMake package registry. Please refer to the Getting Started section to purge the
system of old Zephyr installations.
