# Overview
Lingua Franca's C-runtime supports the [Raspberry Pi RP2040](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RP2040),
an inexpensive microcontroller that is typically used without an operating system ("bare metal").
A series of lab excercises have been developed for instructional use, but these also
serve as the best documentation and guide for developing programs for the RP2040.
These lab exercises use the [Pololu 3pi+ 2040 robot](https://www.pololu.com/docs/0J86),
which has an RP2040, but the exercises can be adapted to other robots and RP2040 platforms.
See the [RP2040 lab page](https://lf-lang.org/embedded-lab/) for more information.
